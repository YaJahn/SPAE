# SPAE

## Introduction

**SPAE** is a novel computational framework designed to analyze cell cycle dynamics and cell differentiation using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. SPAE employs an autoencoder that integrates both nonlinear and piecewise linear components, enabling precise estimation of cell cycle pseudotime and differentiation of cell types.
